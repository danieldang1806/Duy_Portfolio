# [Project 1: Airbnb Value Rating in Los Angeles](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj) 
* Processed 1 million listings in Los Angeles and define the main metric: Value rating
* Larger listings may come up with high expectation from guests, or putting the listing in a densely distributed areas may lower their chance in getting high rating. 
* Managing multiple properties at once can end up with a low value rating rather than their counterparts with less than 5 listings, and these busy hosts may rely on built-in features like Instant Book for a help
* Being specific about amenities promoted can be resulted in a higher value rating
